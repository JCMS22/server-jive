List of improvements:

Test Script:
1. Test script is pretty basic. It should be able to handle error cases and produce a report
2. Test could also test the "close after 10 seconds" by handling a timeout on the socket



C++App:
1. Configuration of the server should be moved to an external file. A JSON formatted file would do the job
2. Server should handle more errors and disconnection
3. Initialization could be done through builders or factory rather than directly in the main.
